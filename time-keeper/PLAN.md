# Time Keeper VSCode Extension Development Plan

## Overview
A VSCode extension that forces developers to take breaks by disabling editor functionality during break periods.

## Features
1. **Timer System**
   - Set work duration (e.g., 25 minutes)
   - Set break duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
   - Display remaining time in status bar and overlay

2. **Editor Lockdown**
   - Make all editors read-only
   - Display semi-transparent overlay (90-95% opacity)
   - Block all editing operations
   - Sync across all VSCode windows

3. **User Interface**
   - Commands to start/stop timer
   - Settings for work/break durations
   - Emergency unlock feature
   - Status bar timer display

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Extension Structure
- [x] Create project structure
- [ ] Set up extension manifest (package.json)
- [ ] Create main extension file
- [ ] Add activation events

### Phase 2: Timer Implementation
- [ ] Create timer service class
- [ ] Implement work/break cycle logic
- [ ] Add timer state management
- [ ] Create timer display in status bar

### Phase 3: Editor Lockdown
- [ ] Implement read-only mode for all editors
- [ ] Create overlay webview
- [ ] Design break screen UI
- [ ] Add keyboard/mouse blocking

### Phase 4: Multi-window Sync
- [ ] Implement file-based communication
- [ ] Sync timer state across windows
- [ ] Handle window open/close events

### Phase 5: User Controls
- [ ] Add commands (start, stop, pause)
- [ ] Create settings configuration
- [ ] Implement emergency unlock
- [ ] Add notification system

### Phase 6: Polish
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Icon design

## Technical Considerations
- VSCode API limitations for cross-window control
- File watcher for multi-window synchronization
- WebView for overlay display
- Global state management
